# challenge_1_seo_optimization_harry_probert

## Description 

i built this project to improve SEO and accessability to an already developed webpage, by consolidating CSS, adding semantics and replacing non-semantics to increase accessability. I added comments in both the HTML and CSS files to improve structure, and edited code with minimal impact to functionality and appearance.
